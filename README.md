# CrowdFood

- We know that we have google and yelp to give us a good review of restaurants about the service and quality. But we need more about the restaurants in real-time. 

- Some hard-working guys care more about the time. I donâ€™t think I want to waste 10 minutes waiting in the line sometime when I try to focus on my work, even if the restaurant has a good feedback in yelp or google. In this occursion, I am not that concerned about if the food is delicious and the service is good enough or not . What I really care about is to save more time for working. 

- We found a way to save you more time -- CrowdFood.

- Anybody in the restaurants who are waiting in line can estimate the time and post a report about how long will we have to wait. Anybody can confirm with the posts that they support. Anybody in the working office or room can have a good understanding of how long they have to wait for each restaurant and make a good option where to eat.
