# CrowdFood

- We know that we have google and yelp to give us a good review of restaurants. How do we judge the service and quality of restaurants. But we need more about the restaurants. For some hard-working guys like us, we care more about the time. I donâ€™t think I want to waste 10 minutes waiting in the line even if the restaurant has a good feedback in yelp or google. I am not that concerned about if the food is delicious or not  and if the service is good enough. What I really care about is to save more time for working. 
We found a way to save you more time. CrowdFood.

- Anybody in the restaurants who are waiting in line can estimate the time and post a report about how long will we have to wait. Anybody can confirm with the posts that they support. Anybody in the office or room can have a good understanding of how long they have to wait for each restaurant and make a good option where to eat.
